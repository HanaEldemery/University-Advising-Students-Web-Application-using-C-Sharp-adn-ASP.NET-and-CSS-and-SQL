# University Advising Students Web Application using C#, ASP.NET, CSS and SQL
I developed a fully functional web application that integrated with my previously designed and implemented database.
The web application was structured around three key user roles: students, advisors, and admins. Each role had specific functionalities that needed to be implemented. For instance, in the student component, I developed features that allowed users to register, log in, manage personal details, view course offerings, and submit requests such as credit hour and course enrollment. This involved creating dynamic web pages that interacted seamlessly with the backend database, ensuring that user inputs were correctly processed and stored.
In addition to the student functionalities, I also worked on the advisor and admin components. The advisor component required implementing features for managing student graduation plans, updating course details, and handling student requests. For the admin component, I was responsible for building interfaces that allowed admins to manage courses, instructors, and students within the system. This included developing functionalities for adding new semesters, linking students to advisors and courses, and overseeing payment and installment processes.
Emphasis was placed on ensuring the application was user-friendly and error-free. This meant implementing comprehensive error handling, providing users with clear feedback for successful and unsuccessful actions, and ensuring that all components were well-integrated. Navigation across the application had to be intuitive, allowing users to move between functionalities without needing to manually change URLs.
This project enhanced my technical skills in web development and database management. The experience I gained from this web application design was invaluable, as it provided a hands-on understanding of how database-driven web applications are developed and maintained in a real-world context.
